# WebProgramming

Welcome to Kody Weigel's Website for my web proagramming shenanigans.

SETUP:
Make a table named db_users and put the contents from the file "db_users.sql" and run.

After that, to access the story you need to make an account and then log in.

TESTING: Two accounts are made a user and an admin, their emails are "user@gmail.com" and "admin@gmail.com". Both passwords are "Password1"
The admin account can view the user list and delete users.


NEW FEATURES:

-Tokenizing data

-Password hashing

-Roles "admin" and "user"

-Backend support (see api)
